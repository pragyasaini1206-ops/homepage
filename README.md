# Homepage Boilerplate

Static, responsive, modern homepage with animated 3D hero, reveal-on-scroll sections, partners marquee, and inter-page transitions.

## Structure

- `index.html` — Home (3D hero, expertise, featured work, process, testimonials, collaboration CTA, partners marquee, contact card)
- `about.html` — About (background, values, experience, CTA)
- `portfolio.html` — Portfolio (case studies, experiments, CTA)
- `contact.html` — Contact (contact card + form, email CTA)
- `assets/css` — Styles and animations
- `assets/js` — Router transition, tilt effect, and reveal logic
- `assets/img/logos` — Placeholder SVG logos for marquee

## Run locally

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve with any static server.
